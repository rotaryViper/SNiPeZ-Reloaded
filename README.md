# SNiPeZ-Reloaded
Revival of SNiPeZ, a game I will finally finish.

This is a little game you can read the source code to learn from.
It is as optimised as I can make it.

Play it your way, although the way I recommend is not moving around and surviving as long as possible in a single position.

The controls are:
WASD - Movement
Mouseclick/ Space Bar - Fire bullets
R - Restart
ESC - Exit

Try to shoot as many enemies as possible, while surviving as long as possible.
You get infinite bullets, but watch out for the cost of bullets. They cost a lotta points!

Have fun :)
Brandon
